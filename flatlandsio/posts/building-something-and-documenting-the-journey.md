i've been wanting to do a project from the start to the end and documet my thoughts and processes hoping to understand things a little better for a while now and came accross this idea of a colaborative documentation system, a sort of list of evolving how-tos. 

<br>

i find myself constantly searching the same things, having to close the same pop ups to find something i could copy paste, or File > Open Project... dig through some older code just so that i could, copy paste. Nothing crazy complex. this goes there, config here - you have a running nginx server. Or this stuff here, socket down there - all users can now paint on the canvas at the same time.

<br>

I'd want a sort of web app sdk, a devkit to all the things. Or at the very least have something in place that i can search a software, version etc and get back *guides. the same *guides that id have to search for, close pop ups for, dig through old code for. it'd be cool if - as software changes and documetation falls out of date - i could easily edit the *guides, like blocks of code.

<br>

<em>*I highlight guides because i jsut want the code. they're  not aimed at "this is the first time i'm trying this" step-by-step folks. more like "i've done this a few times its not but my brain is full... i need it.".I guess, boilerplate... upto date boilerplate.</em>
